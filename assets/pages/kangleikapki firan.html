                <span>The Flag of Kangleipak</span>, also known as the <span>Salai Taret Flag</span>, is a rectangular
                seven-colored flag that
                holds deep historical and cultural significance for the <span>Meitei ethnicity of Ancient
                    Manipur</span>. This flag
                is not merely a piece of cloth but a sacred symbol representing the seven clan dynasties that form the

                        The red color in the flag of Manipur is a tribute to the Mangang clan. This vibrant hue

                        shades of red. The flag's colors draw inspiration from the sun's changing hues throughout the
                        day, each representing the birth times of different clans' progenitors. This symbolism not only

                        Kha Nganba, one of the esteemed seven clans of the Meitei people, is a key part of Manipur’s
                        cultural heritage. This clan, speaking the Meitei language, includes several Yumnaks, the
                        indigenous peoples of ancient Kangleipak, now known as the state of Manipur in India.
                        <br><br>
                        The purple color in the flag of Manipur represents the Kha Nganba clan. This vibrant hue
                        signifies the time of Ibudou Kha Nganba’s birth, which occurred during a period when the sun
                        cast a rich purple glow across the sky. The flag’s colors are inspired by the sun’s changing
                        shades throughout the day, each reflecting the birth times of different clan progenitors. This
                        purple symbolism honors the Kha Nganba clan and highlights the deep cultural traditions of
                        Manipur.

            <h2>Colors and Clans: The Essence of Unity</h2>
            <p>The Flag of Kangleipak is adorned with seven distinct colors, each representing a specific clan dynasty:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Red: Represents the Mangang clan.</li>
                <li>White: Represents the Luwang clan.</li>
                <li>Black: Represents the Khuman clan.</li>
                <li>Yellow: Represents the Angom clan.</li>
                <li>Red mixed with black: Represents the Moirang clan.</li>
                <li>Purple: Represents the Kha-Nganba clan.</li>
                <li>Light Sky blue: Represents the Salai-Leisangthem clan.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The <span>width-to-length ratio</span> of the flag is 2:3, a dimension approved by the <span>Lainingthou
                    Sanamahi Temple Board</span>. This approval underscores the flag's sacred status within the
                community, as the Temple Board is a revered institution preserving the religious and cultural heritage
                of the Meitei people.</p>
            <h2>The Birth of <span>Ibudhou Pakhangba</span>'s Seven Sons</h2>
            <p>
                The symbolism of <span>the Flag of Kangleipak</span> goes deeper, as it is intricately linked to the
                legend of
                <span>Ibudhou Pakhangba</span> and his seven sons. According to ancient Puya (sacred manuscripts), each
                of these sons
                represents one of the seven clans. The colors of the flag are inspired by the hues of the sun at
                different times of the day, corresponding to the birth times of these sons. This connection to celestial
                phenomena emphasizes the divine nature of the clans and their origins.

                The colors of <span>the Flag of Kangleipak</span> are not arbitrary; they are the result of ancient
                dyeing traditions
                that have been meticulously preserved over centuries. The <span>Amaibas</span> and <span>Amaibis</span>
                (traditional priests and
                priestesses) continue to dye fabrics using these seven hues for <span>Apok Khuramba</span>, a sacred
                ritual involving
                the offering of dyed cloth. This practice highlights the deep spiritual connection the Meitei people
                have with the flag, viewing it as more than just a symbol, but a sacred artifact intertwined with their
                religious and cultural identity.
